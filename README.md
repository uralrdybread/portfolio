# Artist Portfolio

## Goals

- Create a beautiful grid layout for an artist's collection of art.
- Implement a fixed top navbar that seamlessly stays at the top of the screen.
- Utilize Alpine.js to incorporate ease-in and ease-out transition effects when hovering over pictures.
- Develop a fully responsive website that looks stunning on both full-screen and mobile devices.
- Design a clear selection hover effect that enhances user navigation.
- Implement a sliding side navbar that activates only when the screen reaches a certain size ratio.
- Add animation to the hamburger icon for smooth transition of the side navbar during deployment.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
